a Web API project and a Gateway project that interacted with this API using ASP.NET Core and C#. 
The first project was a small application focused on performing CRUD operations, such as updating, deleting, and listing data in an SQLite database.
These operations were simplified using EF Core, and the data flow between the database and the user was managed with tools such as Dependency Injection, AutoMapper, and API endpoints.
In addition to creating Web API projects, I also wrote articles (Link for article 1, article 2) covering critical topics, including how to structure Gateway projects and map Gateway URLs to API endpoints. 
This experience significantly enhanced my understanding of fundamental concepts in Microservice architectures.
